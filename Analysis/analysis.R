#This is the R code used in order to analize the previous filtered data with the python script.
#The order of the code is the following:
#		路 Define the functions that we will use in order 
#		  to modify some of the data and to get the csv outputs.
#		路 Load the csv as data.frame().
#		路 Get the variables where we crossed the data.
#		路 Get the csv output for the visualization.
